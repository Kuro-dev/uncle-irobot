Is it your own destiny? Or is it a destiny someone else has tried to force on you?

Be careful what you wish for, Admiral. History is not always kind to its subjects.

Failure is only the opportunity to begin again. Only this time, more wisely.

Are you so busy fighting you cannot see your own ship has set sail?

Good times become good memories, but bad times become good lessons.

It’s time for you to look inward and start asking yourself the big question: who are you and what do you want?

You have light and peace inside of you. If you let it out, you can change the world around you.

Even in the material world, you will find that if you look for the light, you can often find it. But if you look for the dark, that is all you will ever see.

You are going through a metamorphosis, my nephew. It will not be a pleasant experience but when you come out of it. You will be the beautiful prince you were always meant to be.

I know your not supposed to cry over spilt tea but *sniff* it’s just so sad!
